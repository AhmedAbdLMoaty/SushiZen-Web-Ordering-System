# 🍣 SushiZen Web Ordering System

This project implements the REST API backend for the SushiZen web-based ordering platform using **Spring Boot**, with API definitions driven by **OpenAPI (Swagger)**.

All API endpoints for users, cart, menu, orders, admin, and kitchen staff are defined in the `sushi-zen-api.yml` file and implemented with simple in-memory logic suitable for prototyping and initial integration.
